## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Run `ng build --base-href "https://Matthew-The-Developer.github.io/base-layout/"` to build the project for [GitHub Pages](https://matthew-the-developer.github.io/base-layout/). The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Run `npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/base-layout` to deploy the current build of the project to [GitHub Pages](https://matthew-the-developer.github.io/base-layout/).

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
